These scripts were written for my own use to solve miscellaneous issues or to automate certain tasks, this includes a script to find the name of the current desktop wallpaper/background. 

So in my case I usually keep at least three desktops open and they all randomly move through a list of almost 3,000 images. Sometimes one comes up that I would like to delete or that I really like. I needed a way to get the name of that image so I could find it within that folder.

This essentially queries the sqlite database that OSX uses to store current and most recent wallpapers and will present you with that list. 

I had a really hard time finding something that would do this for me so hopefully you will find it useful.
